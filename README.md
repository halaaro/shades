Fake dark-mode for your desktop

Intended to be used during Slack/Zoom/Teams calls where a teammate pulls up a very bright window and you have no defence... well now you can do something about it. Open a shades window and relax.

Also useful for legacy applications that only support light-mode.

### Auto-Dark Mode

`shades` darkens whatever it covers. If the screen beneath is mostly dark already, it does nothing.

### Location and size memory

The window will remember the last position and size it was used. When opened, the new window will be in the same place.

### Running

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/halaaro/shades/releases) page for prebuilt `shades.exe`.
